Gayle McDowell's [crowdsourced CTCI solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition), by programming language.

This group will code through all 189 coding interview questions in Gayle McDowell's book "Cracking the Coding Interview" together. I'll do them in Java, but use any language you wish.

We meet on Skype each Saturday:

**12 pm-1 pm PST on Skype**. To join, put your Skype name in a reply to [this Slack post](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/archives/CDDPLUHQC/p1563394416120600).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java) is my code editor. I installed its [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

I cloned [Gayle's GitHub solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition) and opened the /Java folder in VS Code. It instantly told me what to install and let me start running/debugging code with breakpoints, with NO configuration! Super easy.

If you forked this GitHub repo to your laptop, here's **how to easily keep your fork up to date with mine as I add new code:**

In directory of your `/ctci` folder in the terminal, type:

1. `git remote add upstream git@github.com:rayning0/ctci.git`

2. `git fetch upstream`
3. `git pull upstream master`
4. `git push -f`

Line 1 adds a [remote repo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes) called "upstream" to your fork, pointing to my GitHub repo.

Lines 2-4 update what "upstream" means, pulls the latest code from my /ctci repo, then [force pushes](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/git-push---force-and-how-to-deal-with-it) it up to YOUR repo.

Since I'm don't want to type all these lines, I added these lines to my [`.bash_profile`](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/):

```
function grau { # update fork (part 1)
  git remote add upstream $1
}

function gupdate { # update fork (part 2)
  git fetch upstream
  git pull upstream master
  git push -f
}
```

You only need to type `grau git@github.com:rayning0/ctci.git` once.

In the future, as I add new code to my /ctci repo, you just `cd` to YOUR /ctci fork of mine and type `gupdate`. It will automatically pull my latest code.

If you don't have a `.bash_profile`, create this file in your home directory. After editing it, run the file by doing [`source ~/.bash_profile`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4608187/how-to-reload-bash-profile-from-the-command-line).
